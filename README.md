# Budget-Tracker
Student final Project for advanced Java course. Budget Tracker with categories and dates.
This Budget tracker represents a simple version of a budget managing system, where the user can 
input his/her budget to deal with. The user can determine the expense categories himself 
and specify the amount for each category. The program calculates the total sum 
and warn about the remaining balance.
