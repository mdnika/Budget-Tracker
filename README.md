# Budget Tracker

Student final Project for advanced Java course. 

This BudgetTracker represents a simple version of a budget managing system, where the user can: 
- input his/her budget to deal with;
- determine the expense by himself;
- specify the amount for each expense.
  
The program can:
- print the list of expenses;
- calculates the total sum;
- warns about the remaining balance. 

Nice to have: 
The final list of expenses can be saved in file 'res/expenses.csv', so the user can have a look of his/her total expenses later on. 

This project is programmed with Java Version 20.0 and the start file is BudgetTracker.java

The programm consists of 3 Files/Classes:
- BudgetTracker.java (the enter point of the programm): this file contains the menu (user interface), that helps to choose an action.
- ExpenseList.java: consists of constructor for this class, and all the methods, that are used in the Budget Tracker
- Expense.java: determines the meaning of "Expense" and contains 3 methods. 

The project contains the directory 'res' with the resource file 'expenses.csv'. 
Here all the fix expenses are saved already and the user can save extra expenses too.
